# superhero-api

## Developing a superhero-api with Node, Express and TypeScript2

Test-driven development (TDD) with Mocha and Chai.

Gulp for my process flow. 

No Angular front-end, and no database back-end, just a JSON datafile, so we can focus on the middleware steps. 

1. Project Setup
1. Express Config
1. The API
1. First Endpoint
2. Setting Up Tests
3. Setting Up Routes
1. Second Endpoint

then what?

We can GET all, and get can GET one by id.

Next I could do a Update and Delete?

Then go create a CodePen angular front-end to read from this.... after I get it deployed.
